    "## Pass Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The engine module incorporates three primary types of passes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "Takes a Lark tree as an input and returns a completely new Lark tree. The order in which the nodes are visited can be user-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Visitor / Visitor_Recursive\n",
    "\n",
    "Takes a Lark tree as input and modifies it in-place, if at all. The visitation order is not defined, making this class suitable for cases where nodes are visited without requiring specific context. `Visitor_Recursive` is often the choice for efficiency, as per the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions similarly to the `Visitor` class, but with a defined order for visiting nodes. By default, nodes are visited in breadth-first search (BFS) order from the root of the Lark tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Resources\n",

    "    A rule is considered \"safe\" when it meets certain conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "    * [Rule Safety Conditions](#rule-safety-conditions)\n",

    "    ### Rule Safety Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "    For a rule to be considered safe, the following two conditions must be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 1. Free Variable in Rule Head\n",
    "\n",
    "    Every free variable that appears in the rule head must occur at least once in the body as an output term of a relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `parent(X,Y) <- son(X)` is not a safe rule because the free variable `Y` only appears in the rule head.  \n",
    "    * `parent(X,Z) <- parent(X,Y), parent(Y,Z)` is a safe rule since both `X` and `Z` appear in the rule body.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 2. Bound Free Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    A free variable is considered \"bound\" if it is constrained in a manner that limits the range of values it can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To ensure that every free variable is bound, we must ensure that every relation in the rule body is a safe relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Safe Relations\n",
    "\n",
    "    A safe relation adheres to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Its input relation is safe, meaning all its input's free variables are bound. Normal relations are always considered safe as they don't have input relations.  \n",
    "    * A bound variable is one that exists in the output of a safe relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `rel2(X,Y) <- rel1(X,Z), ie1<X>(Y)` is a safe rule as the only input free variable, `X`, exists in the output of the safe relation `rel1(X, Z)`.  \n",
    "    * `rel2(Y) <- ie1<Z>(Y)` is not safe as the input free variable `Z` does not exist in the output of any safe relation.\n",

    "    ### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "    This pass operates under the following assumptions. Failure to meet these may lead to incorrect results:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. References to relations and IE (Information Extraction) relations, as well as their arity, have been properly checked.\n",
    "    2. Variable references have been verified.\n",
    "    3. The pass only processes a single statement as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Semantic Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "    The pass performs the following specific checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 1. Typed Relation References\n",
    "\n",
    "    It verifies if the relation references in the rule are correctly typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 2. Typed IE Relations\n",
    "\n",
    "    It verifies if the IE relations in the rule are correctly typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 3. Conflicting Types in Free Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "    Checks if free variables within rules have conflicting types. This is crucial to ensure that the rules are logically coherent.\n",
    "\n",
